Typenvibe is a site where you can type along to some of your favorite songs!
The site is currently still under development, so we'd love your feedback!
Let us know what you think [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScSF3rbz6QHUwwMll1AbwFXiBHKaB0aPCQFufgxq_6YNlq2Yg/viewform?usp=sf_link).
If you are interested in the source code, you can find it [here on Github](https://github.com/j0hnk1m/typenvibe).


## User Guide

The object of the game is to type the lyrics of a song as quick as the artist sings it. The lyrics that you type are automatically switched based on the line that the artist is currently on. If the line changes while you are typing a word, never fear, you have the option to type either the word you currently are on, or the word at the beginning of the next line. Here's an example (notice that the accuracy stays at 100% in both cases):
