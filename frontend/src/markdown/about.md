Typenvibe is a site where you can type along to some of your favorite songs!
The site is currently still under development, so we'd love your feedback!
Let us know what you think [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScSF3rbz6QHUwwMll1AbwFXiBHKaB0aPCQFufgxq_6YNlq2Yg/viewform?usp=sf_link).

# User Guide

The object of the game is to type the lyrics of a song as quick as the artist 
sings it. The lyrics that you type are automatically switched based on the line
that the artist is currently on. If the line changes while you are typing a word, 
never fear, you can still finish the word you were previously 
on and it will count towards your score!
